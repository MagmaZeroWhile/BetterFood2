# BETTER FOOD - REWORK
Rework of the BetterFood plugin, now updated and with support for 2 languages!
- More Than 20 Foods to Eat!

## WHY?
Honestly I never liked how Mojang implemented the food system. It constantly takes players out of what they're doing in order to fill up a meaningless bar. I do understand that food is important for a survival game, but I think holding down right click for a few seconds every couple of minutes does not make for a compelling game mechanic.

## WHAT ABOUT OTHER FOOD?
Raw foods and foods that give buffs are best left to manage by the player. I would not want players to waste raw food they're harvesting for cooking, nor am I making this plugin to make people lazier about food. If people are willing to put the effort in to cook or craft their food, they get to have it refill automatically. Sounds like a good balance, right?
